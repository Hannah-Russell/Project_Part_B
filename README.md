# Everyday Ephemera: A Digital Archiving Project

This repository is a personal digital archive created as part of a digital curation course project. It demonstrates how GitHub can be used to organize and preserve digital items using basic metadata and a clear folder structure. The focus of this project is on **digital archiving**—preserving small, everyday materials that may not be considered important at first glance, but still hold personal or cultural value.

## 📁 Project Structure

All items are stored in a single collection folder called `Archive_Collection_2024`, which is divided into two exhibits:

```
Archive_Collection_2024/
├── Exhibit_A_Personal_History/
│   ├── note_to_self.txt
│   ├── old_receipt.txt
│   └── metadata.json
├── Exhibit_B_Travel_Notes/
│   ├── fake_postcard.txt
│   ├── travel_plan.txt
│   ├── flight_confirmation.txt
│   └── metadata.json
```

Each `.txt` file represents a digitized placeholder item. The `metadata.json` file in each exhibit contains descriptive metadata about each item using fields based on the Dublin Core standard.

## 🗃️ Metadata Standards

This project uses simplified **Dublin Core** metadata fields:
- **Title** – Name of the item  
- **Date** – When the item was created  
- **Description** – A short explanation of what the item is  
- **Format** – File type  
- **Source** – Where the item came from  

Metadata is stored in `metadata.json` files for clarity and portability.

## 🧭 Purpose and Audience

This project is designed to show how digital archives can be created without expensive tools or hosting platforms. It may be useful for:
- Students learning about metadata and digital preservation  
- Educators looking for example structures  
- Anyone interested in low-barrier digital archiving  

## 🔒 Rights

This content is created for educational purposes. All items are fictional or personally created and not intended for commercial use.

## 📌 Notes

This is a learning project and not intended to function as a professional-grade archive. The focus is on:
- Practicing metadata creation  
- Organizing a clear file structure  
- Exploring accessible tools for digital curation
